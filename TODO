RXSD is a work in progress and is not current stable.

Various features left to be implemented

  * simple binary to generate file ruby definitions
  * ruby gem / pkg spec
  * readme / simple howto (run bin, import lib, add builder/xml-backend)
  * bug fixing (expanding the test suite in the process)
  * Support for missing XSD constructs:
     - all / annotation / any / anyAttribute / appInfo / documentation / field /
       import / include / key / keyref / notation / redefine / selector / union / unique
     - add remote uri support to Loader, use in conjunction w/ import/include
  * Additional builtin / native type support
  * Additional builder support
  * Support for ruby class/obj -> xsd/xml
  * C/C++ rewrite (?)
