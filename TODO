RXSD is a work in progress and is not current stable.

Various features left to be implemented

  * LOTS of bug fixing (expanding the test suite in the process)
  * Support for missing XSD constructs:
     - all / annotation / any / anyAttribute / appInfo / documentation / field /
       import / include / key / keyref / notation / redefine / selector / union / unique
  * Make Builder interface more generic, w/ subclasses for ruby classes, defintions, whatever else
  * Means to autocovert XSD conforming XML into instances of classes created 
  * C/C++ rewrite (?)
  * More design cleanup / doing things the "right" way 
    (make things more plugable, including additional XML backend support)
